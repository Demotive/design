      <p>Usually nail infections affect your toenails but you can get them on
        your finger nails too.</p>

      <p>They can be painful and cause the skin around the nail to swell.</p>

      <p>You can usually treat fungal nail infections yourself at home without
        seeing the GP.</p>

      <p>The affected nail will grow out. It can take up to 12 months for a
        healthy nail to grow back.</p>

      <p>Fungal nail infections are caused by a fungus. You are more likely to
        get them if you have athlete’s foot.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="#">Medical detail about fungal nail infections.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Treat smaller infections without medicine</h2>

      <p>You should:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>keep your feet clean and dry</li>
        <li>use separate clippers or scissors to cut your infected nails</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you can see a healthy nail grow back at the base the infection has
        stopped. Cut the old nail off as it grows out.</p>

      <p>You can also buy antifungal nail paint online or at the pharmacy. It
        can take 6 to 12 months to cure the infection, depending on the size
        of the nail and it doesn’t always work.</p>

      <p>If you have diabetes you should see a foot specialist because any
        injuries can <a href="#">lead to complications.</a></p>

        Use medicated cream for bigger or painful infections

      <h2>You should use a cream that removes the nail if it’s:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>painful</li>
        <li>bothering you</li>
        <li>spreading to other nails</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can buy the cream online (search for ‘fungal nail removal cream’)
        or at the pharmacy. It takes about 2 weeks to get rid of the infected
        nail and it’s painless.</p>

      <h2>See your GP for severe nail infections</h2>

      <p>Your GP can prescribe you tablets. The most common ones are
        terbinafine and itraconazole.</p>

      <p>The tablets can have side effects including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>headaches</li>
        <li>itching</li>
        <li>loss of sense of taste</li>
        <li>diarrhoea</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Antifungal tablets can damage your liver. Your GP will do a blood
        test before prescribing these as you shouldn’t take them if you have
        certain conditions or you’re pregnant.</p>

      <p>Sometimes badly infected nails have to be removed by surgery. It’s a
        small operation done under local anaesthetic.</p>

      <p>For severe infections you can also get laser treatment to destroy
        the fungus. However, you’ll have to pay for it yourself as it’s not
        covered by the NHS.</p>

      <h2>Keep your feet clean and dry to prevent nail infections</h2>

      <p>Nail infections develop when your feet are constantly warm and damp.
        You’re more likely to get an infection if you wear trainers for a long
        time and have hot, sweaty feet.</p>

      <p>Treat athlete’s foot as soon as possible to avoid it spreading to the
         nails.</p>

      <p>Things that will help prevent nail infections:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>keep your feet clean and dry</li>
        <li>wear clean socks every day</li>
        <li>don’t wear shoes that make your feet hot and sweaty</li>
        <li>wear flip flops in showers at the gym, pool etc</li>
        <li>don’t share towels</li>
        <li>throw out old shoes</li>
        <li>don’t wear other people’s shoes</li>
      </ul>
