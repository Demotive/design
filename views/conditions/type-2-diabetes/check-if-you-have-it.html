          <p>Talking to a therapist can help with:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>understanding why you feel the way you feel</li>
            <li>dealing with negative thoughts and feelings</li>
            <li>finding ways of coping every day</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Usually treatment for depression and anxiety can include: talking to a therapist, medication, and self-help such as exercise.</p>

          <p>There are many different types of talking treatments.  The charity Mind has more information about <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/talking-treatments/types-of-therapy/#.VmBFKHbhCM8">types of therapy.</a></p>

          <h3 id="how-to-get-therapy-on-the-nhs">How to get therapy on the NHS</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Speak to your GP about the way you feel.</li>
            <li>If your GP thinks therapy is the best treatment, they’ll either refer you for therapy in your area or give you the number for a service that provides therapy in your area.</li>
            <li>You phone the local service, or they’ll call you (if your GP referred you), they’ll ask you some questions and refer you to a therapist.</li>
          </ol>       
          
          <p>Alternatively, you can call your local service without speaking to your GP. <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Psychological-therapies-(IAPT)/LocationSearch/10008">Check you have IAPT services (Improving Access to Pyschological Treatment) in your area.</a></p>

          <div class="callout notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
              <p>Some GPs put you directly in touch with a therapist or have a therapist in their practice.</p>
          </div>   

          <h3 id="waiting-times-can-be-long">Waiting times can be long</h3>

          <p>Waiting times can range from a few weeks to up to one year.</p>

          <p>Ask your GP about waiting times when they refer you. If they’re too long you might want to consider paying for therapy yourself (see below).</p>

          <h3 id="therapy-is-around-6-to-12-sessions">Therapy is around 6 to 12 sessions</h3>
          <p>The NHS usually covers 6 to 12 sessions. A session is around one hour.</p>

          <p>After that you’ll have to review your situation with your GP. They might prescribe further sessions or recommend something else. Sometimes simple changes, like exercising regularly, might help.</p>

          <h3 id="changing-therapists">Changing therapists</h3>

          <p>It’s important you feel comfortable with your therapist and can be open with them. If this isn’t the case, the sessions won’t help you.</p>

          <p>There are no rules about how to find this out. You have to trust your instinct.</p>

          <p>If you’re not happy with your NHS therapist you should do the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Think about why you feel therapy isn’t working.</li>
            <li>Speak to your GP about the problem.</li>
            <li>If you both agree you should continue with therapy, your GP should be able to refer you to a new therapist.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 id="paying-for-therapy-yourself">Paying for therapy yourself</h3>
          <p>You can also go directly to a therapist without using the NHS. You don’t need a referral from your GP and you can usually start right away.</p>

          <p>The price per therapy session varies between £10 and £100, depending on where you live. Bigger cities, like London tend to be more expensive. Some therapists adjust their prices according to your income.</p>

          <p>The charity <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a> offers counselling free of charge.</p>

          <p>If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your GP about the way you feel, you can contact one of the charities that help people with depression and anxiety.</p>

          <p>They can help you with things like talking to other people about your problem or finding a therapist, but they won’t be able to prescribe you free therapy or counselling.</p>

          <p>A type of therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is available online and it may be free on the NHS, depending where you live.</p>

          <p>The benefits of computerised CBT include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>no waiting time</li>
            <li>you don’t need a lot of experience on computers to use them</li>
            <li>research shows they work</li>
            <li>you can use them any time</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Your GP can refer you for computerised CBT or you can refer yourself at:</p>
