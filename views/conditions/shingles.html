      <h2>Check if you have shingles</h2>

      <p>The first sign of shingles can be:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin</li>
        <li>headache or feeling generally unwell</li>
      </ul>

      It may be a few days before the rash appears.

      <p>It’s most common on your chest and tummy but can appear on your face,
        eyes and genitals.</p>

      <h2>When to see your GP</h2>

      <p>Speak to your GP if you suspect shingles, particularly if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>it’s on your face and eyes</li>
        <li>your child has it</li>
        <li>you’re elderly</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your GP may prescribe you antiviral tablets. They should be taken
        within 72 hours of your rash appearing.</p>

      <p>Antiviral tablets can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>reduce how long your shingles lasts</li>
        <li>reduce how severe your shingles is</li>
        <li>prevent complications, like nerve pain</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can buy painkillers to ease shingles pain.</p>

      <p>It can take up to 4 weeks for the rash to heal. Pain can stay for weeks
         after the rash has gone, but it usually settles in time.</p>

      <h2>There are things you can do ease your symptoms</h2>

      <h3>Do</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>keep the rash clean and dry to reduce risk of infection</li>
        <li>wear loose-fitting clothing</li>
        <li>use calamine lotion to ease itching</li>
        <li>use a cool compress (a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel or a wet cloth) a few times a day</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Don’t</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>let dressings or plasters stick to the rash</li>
        <li>use antibiotic cream &mdash; this slows healing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stay away from certain groups of people if you have shingles</h2>

      <p>Chickenpox can be dangerous for certain groups of people, so try to avoid:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>pregnant women who have not had chickenpox before</li>
        <li>people with a weakened immune system, such as someone with HIV or AIDS</li>
        <li>babies less than one month old (unless it is your own baby, as they should
          be protected from the virus by your immune system)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stay off work or school until the rash scabs</h2>

      <p>Shingles is contagious only while the rash oozes fluid. If the rash is
        covered (with clothes), there’s little risk of passing the infection on
        to others.</p>

      <h2>You can’t get shingles from chickenpox</h2>

      <p>Shingles is only contagious while the rash oozes fluid.</p>

      <p>You can’t get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.</p>

      <p>However, you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles, if you
        haven’t had chickenpox before.</p>

      <h2>Shingles and pregnancy</h2>

      <p>If you’re pregnant and get shingles, there is no danger to your
        pregnancy or baby.</p>

      <p>If your GP thinks you need medicine, they may speak to a specialist to
        decide whether the benefits of medication outweigh any possible risk.</p>
