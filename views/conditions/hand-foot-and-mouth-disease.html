      <p>Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common infection that mostly
        affects children under 10.</p>

      <p>Hand, foot and mouth disease usually clears up by itself, within
        about a week.</p>

      <h2>Check if you have hand, foot and mouth disease</h2>

      <p>The first sign of hand, foot and mouth disease can be:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a sore throat</li>
        <li>a fever, typically 38&ndash;39C</li>
        <li>loss of appetite</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It may be a few days before the ulcers and rash appear.</p>

      <p>If you’re unsure it’s hand, foot and mouth disease, look at other
        <a href="#">childhood rashes.</a></p>

      <h2>Things you can do at home to ease the symptoms:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>drink fluids to avoid dehydration (avoid acidic drinks, like fruit juice)</li>
        <li>eat soft foods like soup</li>
        <li>take paracetamol or ibuprofen can help ease a sore throat and bring down a temperature</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mouth ulcer gels, sprays, and mouthwashes, might ease the blisters.</p>

      <p>When you buy medicines, always check they are suitable for children
        and give the correct dose.</p>

      <div class="callout gp">
        <h2 class="heading">When to see a GP:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>if your child isn’t better after a week</li>
          <li>if your child is dehydrated &mdash; they’re not weeing as often as usual</li>
          <li>if you’re concerned about your child’s symptoms</li>
          <li>if you’re pregnant and develop hand, foot and mouth disease</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads easily</h2>

      <p>It’s best to avoid close contact with anyone with hand, foot and
        mouth disease.</p>

      <p>Individual schools and nurseries may have their own guidance for when
        your child can return so it’s best to check with them.</p>

      <p>Generally, keep them away from school or nursery while they are feeling
         unwell. There’s no need to keep them off until the blisters have
         healed.</p>

      <h2>Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy</h2>

      <p>There’s normally no risk to the pregnancy or baby.</p>

      <p>However, it’s best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand,
        foot and mouth disease.</p>

      <p>There’s limited evidence that in very rare cases catching hand, foot
        and mouth disease during the first three months of pregnancy could
        lead to miscarriage &mdash; due to the fever. However, this risk is very
         low.</p>
